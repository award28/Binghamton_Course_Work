CS-220 Spring 2016 Lab 11 report		Due: April 25, 2016

Name: Austin Ward

1. What is the deepest level of stack frame nesting that occured in the factorial program?
	The deepest level was 5.	

2. What information can you derive from a dump of the fact function's stack frame?
	The stack frame returns the factorial of the number entered, also the return address and the callers base pointer.

3. Is it more clear to print out the entire stack, or just the current stack frame?  When would you 
   want to see the entire stack, and when would you just be interested in the current stack frame?
	It's more clear to print out the current stack if your using recursion. If you're not, it's easier to print out the entire stack.

4. Can you think of any good ways to improve the printout of the stack frame information?  If so, how?
   (Bonus points will be awarded for the best implementation of improvements... include an example of
   your results.)
	Yes, I believe printing out the local variable information could be useful as well.

5. Can you think of any other reason for using the capability for C to access or use information or
   instructions at the X86 level? If so, describe what you would do in a sentence or two.
	To help people who are already familiar with C become familiar with x86.
