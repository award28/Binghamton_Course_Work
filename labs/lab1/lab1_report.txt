S-220 Fall 2015 Lab 01 Report Due Friday Feb. 05

1. Name two advantages of a command line interface:

	Quick to switch files after learning the commands.
	It's universal.

2. What does the "helloWorld" program you wrote do?

	Prints "Hello World-welcome to C!" to the terminal.

3. What changed between the time you ran "make test" the first time, and "make test" the second time?  Why?

	When I ran make the first time(after "make clean"), the make file redid the command with 
	the correct flags and name to create the helloWorld file. The second time I ran it, the 
	make file had made the helloWorld file, so it didn't need to run that command again.

4. What was the value of "argc" in gdb after the gdb command "run arg1 arg2"?  Why was argc this value?

	The value of argc is equal to 3 after the command "run arg1 arg2".
	argc was this value because there are now more arguments available.

5. What was the value of "argv[3]" in gdb after "run arg1 arg2"? Why was "argv[3]" this value?

	argv[3] is equal to 0x0 after the command "run arg1 arg2".
	argv[3] was set to this value because it is out of bounds of the arguments we created,
	thus it is not stored in any memory location.
