CS-220 Spring 2013 Lab 13 report		Due: May 6, 2015

Name: Austin Ward

1. Which command took more user time; parallel or sequential?  Which did you expect to take more user time, and why?
    parallel. sequential, as parallel works more at once.

2. Which command took more elapsed time; parallel or sequential?  Why?
    sequential, as parallel works more process' at once.

3. Which command utilized a higher percentage of the CPU cores?  Why?
    parallel, as it uses more cores at once.

4. If there were no overhead and the machine you are running on has two CPU cores, what would you expect the parallel CPU core percentage value to be?
    double the value of a single process.

5. Is there a difference between the answer to 4 above, and the percentage of core that the timer reported for you parallel run? If so, do you have any idea why?
    Yes, because my PC is using more process' than just the once I'm running, which reports a un-approximated number.
