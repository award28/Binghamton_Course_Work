I have done this assignment completely on my own. 
I have not copied it, nor have I given my solution 
to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved 
in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an 
official form that I have cheated and that this 
form will be stored in my official university 
record. I also understand that I will receive a 
grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first 
offense and that I will receive a grade of “F” for 
the course for any additional offense.
