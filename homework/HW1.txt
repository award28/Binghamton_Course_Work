CS220 Homework 1 Due Feb. 05, 2016

1. Given the following code, and assuming short ints are 16 bits wide, and ints are 32 bits wide:
 
 	short int x=-5;
 	int y;
 	y=x;
 	
    a. What is the value of y in decimal?
        The value of y is -5.
    b. What are the values of x and y in hexadecimal?
        In hex, the value of x is 0xfffb and y is 0xfffffffb.
    c. Does padding on the left with the sign bit to increase precision change the value of a negative number?
    	If so, why?  If not, why not?
            No, it doesnt change the value. This is because the compiler knows the value is signed, thus it keeps it signed.

2. Given the following code:

	unsigned char m_and = x & mask;	
	unsigned char m_or = x | mask;
	unsigned char m_land = x && mask;
	unsigned char m_lor = x || mask;
	
   Complete the following table, representing each value in hexadecimal:
   (the first row has been completed for you)
   
         x  | mask |m_and | m_or |m_land|m_lor
       -----+------|------+------+------+------
   	a. 0x01 | 0xff | 0x01 | 0xff | 0x01 | 0x01
   	b. 0x08 | 0xf0 | 0x00 | 0xf8 | 0x01 | 0x01
   	c. 0xc7 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0xc7 | 0x00 | 0x01   	
    d. 0x0e | 0x01 | 0x00 | 0x0f | 0x01 | 0x01  
   	e. 0x00 | 0x0f | 0x00 | 0x0f | 0x00 | 0x01
   	
    	
3. Given the following code, and assuming ints are 32 bits wide:
	int x=0x00000011;
	int y=0xFFFFFFFC;
	
	a. What is the hexadecimal value of x+y?
        0xd.

	b. What is the decimal value of x, and y?
        x is 17 and y is -4. 

	c. What is the decimal value of (x+y)?
        13.

	d. Do you get the same answer for (x+y) using either hexadecimal arithmetic, or decimal?    	
    	Yes, thanks to 2's Compliment.

  4. Put an X next to each of the following valid reason to use commmand line development instead of an
     integrated development environment (IDE):
     
     	___ The command line strategy is easier to learn than an IDE.
     	_X_ Command line tools are available in many different environments.
     	_X_ The command line tools are open source and free.
     	___ IDE's are old fashioned... modern developers always use a command line strategy.
     	_X_ I will learn more about the underlying concepts if I use a command line strategy,
     	    an IDE may make it easier, but often hides the underlying concepts.
   (I wish) If I use command line development, I will get a free ice-cream cone.
     	_X_ Even though it may be harder, and require more knowledge, everything that can be
     	    done with an IDE can also be done using command line development.
    	
  5. Given the following code:
  
  	int x; int y; int s_sum;
  	unsigned int v; unsigned int w; unsigned int u_sum;
  	
  	x=atoi(argv[2]);
  	y=atoi(argv[3]);
  	v=x;
  	w=y;
  	s_sum=x+y;
  	u_sum=v+w;
  	if (s_sum==u_sum) printf("Unsigned and signed are the same\n");
  	else printf("Unsigned and signed are different\n");
  	
     a. What do you expect to see printed for most values of argv[2] and argv[3]?
        "Unsigned and signed are the same".

     b. Are there any values of argv[2] and argv[3] which will result in "Unsigned and signed are different"?
        No, since there are unsigned bits the entire program is unsigned.

     c. If you changed "s_sum=x*y;" and "u_sum=v*w;" will you get the same results?
        Yes.
