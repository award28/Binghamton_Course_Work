CS220 Homework 2 Due Feb. 12, 2016

Name: Austin Ward

1. Given the following code:
	int x = -5;
	int y = x/2;
	int z = x>>1;
	
   a. Will "y" and "z" have the same value?  If so, why? If not, why not?
	No they won't have the same value, because z is bit shifting the values of x. If they were to have the same values, it'd be by coincidence. 
   
   b. Is the statement "shifting to the right is the same as dividing by two" correct?
	No, shifting to the right is not correct, especially as the numbers get larger. A shifting of bits can have a much larger effect on large scale numbers.

2. Is there anything wrong with the following code?  If so, what is the problem?

	int main(int argc,char **argv) {
		int x;
		x=getFirst(23);
		if (x==12) return 1;
		return 0;
	}
	int getFirst(int st) {
		return (st*124639 % 332167);
	}
	
	The code above doesn't contain a prototype for the funtion 'getFirst,' therefore it won't compile.	
3. Given the following Code:

	int x; 
	x=14;
	x=x++;
	
   What will the value of "x" be after the code is executed?  Why?
	x will be equal to 15 after this code has been executed. The '++' operation is an indication to add 1 to the digit.
	
4. Given the following invocation of a command generated from C code:

	./mycmd this is a test
	
   What will be the values of:
   
   a. argc	5
   b. argv[1]	"This"
   	
5. Given the following C code:

	int x=atoi(argv[1]);
	int y=(x | (-1-x));
	if (y==-1) printf("Does OR act the same as ADD?\n");
	
   Is there any value of x for which you will NOT print "Does OR act the same as ADD?"?
   If so, what is that value?
	The value 0 is the only value the following code will not print the statement for.
