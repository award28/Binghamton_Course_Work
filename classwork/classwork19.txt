CW 19: Implementing Graphs

Draw a representation of the memory matrix and the linked list for the following graph
Assume that
    a vertex index requires two bytes
    a pointer requires four bytes
    an edge weight requires two bytes
What's the memory cost of each implementation
    When would you prefer one over the other?
